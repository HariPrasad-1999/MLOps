# MLFlow 


MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. Developed by Databricks, MLflow simplifies the process of tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. Itâ€™s designed to work seamlessly with popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and [more](https://medium.com/@roshmitadey/mastering-machine-learning-model-lifecycle-with-mlflow-ff0e81c5963a).
